"Whereas all government ought to be instituted and supported for the security and 
protection of the community as such, and to enable the individuals who compose it 
to enjoy their natural rights, and the other blessings which the Author of existence
has bestowed upon man; and whenever these great ends of government are not obtained, 
the people have a right, by common consent to change it, and take such measures as 
to them may appear necessary to promote their safety and happiness"
	--Pennsylvania Declaration of Rights and Constitution
